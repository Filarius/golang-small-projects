Genetic algorithm for deblur preprocessing

Idea is about prepare image before blur so after blur it will be somekind more similar to original picture

Change constants in CorePool.Init

Keyboard keys is Enter, Numpad 9,7 and 6 to make some changes realtime

Use images for blur core and reference image
